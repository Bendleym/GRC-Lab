# GRC Policy, Risk & Audit Lab

### Overview
This lab simulates a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) environment designed to demonstrate policy creation, risk assessment, vendor management, and audit preparation aligned with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 frameworks.

### Objectives
- Identify and assess organizational security risks
- Map controls to frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF)
- Conduct mock vendor and access reviews
- Develop audit-ready documentation

### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel, SharePoint (simulated), Vanta (conceptual), PowerShell (access review examples)

### Key Deliverables
- Risk Register and Compliance Matrix
- Policy and Procedure Documents
- Vendor Assessment and Access Review Reports
- Business Continuity Plan outline

## 🧩 Architecture Overview
This project models a real GRC workflow across six documentation layers:

1. **Governance:** Policy Playbook (ISO 27001-aligned policies)  
2. **Risk:** Risk Register scoring likelihood × impact  
3. **Compliance:** Matrix mapping ISO, SOC 2, and NIST controls  
4. **Access:** Quarterly user privilege review with remediation tracking  
5. **Vendor:** Third-party security questionnaire and risk rating  
6. **Continuity:** BCP defining critical systems, RTO/RPO, and testing cadence
