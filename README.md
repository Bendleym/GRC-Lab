# 📊 Vulnerability Risk Workflow Automation Lab (Tenable API + Power Automate)

## 🔍 Overview
This lab simulates a vulnerability risk and remediation workflow by integrating Tenable scan results through API and automating remediation tracking using Power Automate. The goal is to model how security and compliance teams operationalize vulnerability data into measurable remediation outcomes and audit evidence.

## 🎯 Lab Goals
- Pull vulnerability scan results via Tenable API
- Normalize findings into a structured remediation workflow
- Build severity scoring, escalation logic, and ticket aging metrics
- Produce remediation SLA visibility and exception justification for risk owners

## 🧰 Tools Used
Tenable API, Power Automate, Microsoft Excel, SharePoint style evidence structure

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary
- Ingested Tenable findings through API into a tracking dataset
- Implemented severity scoring and prioritization logic
- Built escalation rules and aging metrics for remediation visibility
- Created an SLA oriented dashboard for compliance evidence and reporting
- Modeled exception handling and risk owner justification workflows

## 📌 Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated how vulnerability data becomes actionable remediation work
- Built tracking and reporting aligned to audit evidence needs
- Strengthened understanding of remediation SLAs, backlog, and risk acceptance
